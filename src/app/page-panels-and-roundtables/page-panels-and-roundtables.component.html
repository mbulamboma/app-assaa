    <h4 class="h4">01. Communication and Power in African Politics (Society)</h4>
    <p>This panel aims to reflect on character, correlation, function, and meaning between communication and power in African politics (society). People and organisations live (survive) in “communication and power” every day around the world (not only in the public scenes), including Africa. We have seen various types of political communication, from the presidential palace to the streets, from public ceremonies for celebrating the national hero to everyday derision or mocking against the “beloved” national leader, from an authoritarian regime to a more democratic regime, allowing broad freedom of speech. Scholars of African politics have likely focused on the relations from top to down and merely from down to the top. However, we also need to focus on the political approaches of the powerless actors, carefully studying the hidden texts (Scott, 1990): underground practices of resistance to the state (or powerful actors), such as derision (sketches, popular theatre, caricature of newspapers, and satire newspapers), popular song, etc. This panel examines political communication-related acts that take place at various locations and times and then compares these acts in order to understand communication and power in African politics (society) more comprehensively. We welcome papers from Africanist scholars of different academic disciplines in human and social science.</p>

    <h4 class="h4">02. The First Thousand Days of Life; Reproductive and Early Life Interventions</h4>
    <p>The panel addresses the question of what it is to be human by considering a newly emergent knowledge field, ‘the first thousand days of life’. Shaped by new epigenetic findings about heritability and older concerns about population health and growth, this field anticipates that ‘investments’ in early childhood will have positive individual and population effects over time, including generationally. The field has the capacity to reinvigorate questions about entitlements – to health, redress, etc. – at the same time as it reinstates older (and often colonial) models of relationship, responsibility and care. The panelists will consider the making of this field and critically engage with its potentialities, including the potential to remake knowledge about human becoming. We will pay particular attention to the raced and gendered assumptions of prevailing knowledge systems, and to the effects of policies enacted in their name.</p>

    <h4 class="h4">03. Critical Mass Mobilisation and Institutional Design for State-Building in Africa</h4>
    <p>This panel is proposed by the African Leadership Centre (ALC), a Pan African initiative based at the University of Nairobi and Kings College London, which mobilises the critical mass of African youth for action on peace and security leadership. It will focus on emerging themes in the generation and dissemination of knowledge to respond to the most vexing and perplexing challenges at the nexus of peace, security and development on the continent. The discussions will feature some of the current research on mid-generation impact research, complexities of knowledge production in various regions in Africa, and the processes through which bridges are erected or dismantled in post-conflict reconstruction. Related themes that will be explored include the notions and trajectories of institutional design and how social identities interact with state-building efforts in Africa. These themes are in line with the scope of the conference that aims to address old questions in new imaginaries in contemporary Africa.</p>

    <h4 class="h4">04. Relations to Plants as a Heritage From Below in African Cities</h4>
    <p>This double panel aims at gathering researchers in social sciences and humanities reflecting on the knowledge and forms of attachment to plants of the inhabitants of African cities, as part of the urban heritages produced from below and rarely recognised by the local and international institutions.</p>
    <p>This double panel is built around INFRAPATRI, an interdisciplinary research programme (2021-2025) focusing on the knowledge and forms of attachment to plants of the inhabitants of Yaoundé (Cameroon), Ibadan (Nigeria), Porto-Novo (Benin Republic) and Dakar (Senegal). It will aim at discussing the first results of the programme by bringing together researchers in the social sciences and humanities working on similar topics in African cities.</p>
    <p>The memorial relationships of city dwellers to plants, among other alternative heritage dynamics, are rarely recognised by the institutions (Cousin, Mengin 2011). However since their foundation, African cities have included multiple plants and green spaces (Sheridan and Nyamweru 2007). Today, they are often threatened by urbanisation policies, even if plants have also been recently brought back into fashion in many African cities, under the banner of the ‘sustainable city’ model put forward by international cooperation and development agencies (Myers 2016).</p>
